The concept we chose will inform the people in Roosevelt Island what happens in the Senior Center and how it could also assist the other seniors that do not go to the Senior Center. It is a way to advertise the center to the world and itâ€™s benefits to Roosevelt Island. One of the device will be located in front of the Senior Center and the other inside. It will make it easier for those that want to know more about the SC through the device. It will display pictures, videos, conversations, calendar of activities, food menu, and to registration if they are not already members. The activities and display at the SC will help attract more people to the center.
